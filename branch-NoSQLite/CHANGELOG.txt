 Improved performance of the IRC bot and the task scheduler.
 Fixed a bug with getting the server url from the externalurl.txt file crashing the IRC MessageHandler() when the file didn't exist. FORWARD_ALL is now enabled for both SERVER and IRC for 100% transparent chatting.
 Fixed a bug in the server-to-irc code that forwarded a blank message if there was nothing after '#' in server chat.
 Handshake packet is now written when doing /join, to replace MOTD with a more informative "Now loading [worldname]".

 *MULTIWORLD*. It's finally here. See /help for information on new commands: /worlds, /wload, /join
 Added a persistent world list, saved in worlds.txt - this is subject to change. The file contains a list of world names, each corresponding to an .fcm file. The first world listed at the top of worlds.txt is the default/main one.
 *IRC BOT*. Thanks to the efforts by Destroyer661, fCraft now has an optional IRC bot for relaying chat and commands.
 A field has been added in the config to allow forwarding ALL IRC CHANNEL TRAFFIC to the server. This will override the prefix and make it inactive. 'IRCBotForwardAll' is set to false by default.
 *ZONES*. It is now possible to make guest zones and op zones (and anything in-between) on any map. See /help for information on new commands: /zones, /zone, /zremove.
