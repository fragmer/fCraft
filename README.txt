Each branch contains a different snapshot of fCraft's code. Branches are:

    /tags/          Code snapshots corresponding to STABLE fCraft releases.
                    These are the versions that you should use for any mods.

    /branch-0.10x/  First ever version of fCraft. Does not work. Not updated.

    /branch-0.33x/  Oldest version of fCraft that still works.
                    Last version without multiworld. No longer updated.

    /branch-0.53x/  Previous stable version of fCraft. No longer updated.

    /branch-0.60x/  Current stable version of fCraft. Updated with bugfixes.
                    Can sometimes contain unstable or untested code.

    /branch-0.70x/  Abandoned experimental branch. Don't use it.
