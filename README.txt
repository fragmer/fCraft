Each branch contains a different snapshot of fCraft's code. Branches are:

    /branch-0.33x/  Oldest version of fCraft that still works.
                    Last version without multiworld. No longer updated.

    /branch-0.53x/  Previous stable version of fCraft. No longer updated.

    /branch-0.60x/  Current in-development version of fCraft. Under
                    active development. Can sometimes contain unstable or
                    untested code.

    /branch-MySQL/  Experimental branch with MySQL support for the backend
                    player record storage. Unstable.

    /tags/0.610/    Code corresponding to fCraft release 0.610. Stable.
                    This is the codebase that you probably want to use for
                    any mods.
